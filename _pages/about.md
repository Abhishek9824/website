About Me
======
Hello everyone, I'm Abhishek a final year undergraduate at [Delhi University](https://www.du.ac.in/) majoring in Biology. I am very interested in quantitative biology  and my research interests include theoretical ecology, population dynamics, and computational biology. I have experience working with programming languages such as Python and R. I also worked in the field of network biology, understanding macromolecule interactions and analyzing biological systems. 

This site is a collection of my research work, projects and notes in Biological sciences. The navigation bar at the top has the links to the appropriate pages. Most of my content are wriiten in LaTex, source code can be found in this [repository](https://github.com/Abhishek9824/Notes/blob/main/LaTex).
