I work in thereotical and computational biology. My most recent research interests are in developing and applying mathematical concepts to biology. I also have interests in, spartial and stochastic dynamics applied to ecological system. I utilized the concepts and ideas from non-linear dynamics to understand how populations changes over time and their pattern.
